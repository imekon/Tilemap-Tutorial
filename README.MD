# Tilemap Tutorial

created by Pete Goodwin, 24th April 2020

I was following a tutorial on platformers, and using Kenney graphics came up with this.

The tutorial starts here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMsMtPVUtUE&t=1s

I started thinking about a platformer after playing "Room 13" and wondered how hard it would be to do something like it.
